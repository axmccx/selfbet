# Selfbet

Selfbet is an android app which aims to improve your lifestyle by having you and friend place bets on yourselves. 

Bet that you will: 

- Wake up without snoozing your alarm
- Visit any physical location, eg., the gym
- Contact someone by phone or text
- Enforce the use of an app, eg., meditation or workout app
- Reduce the use of a distracting app, eg., facebook, instagram, reddit
- Limit spending at a certain store, (will require bank connection), eg., limit myself to $10 a week at Tim Horton's.
- Tie in with Google fit, fitbit or fitness app to track steps taken or km walked in a day. 

All bets can be configured with frequency per time period. For example, "I bet that I will not snooze my alarm more than twice every 7 days."

The goal is to have a bets that can be "enforced" by the app itself, and doesn't rely on your honesty. 

## How does it work?

You start by making an account and fund it. (Fake money used for now...)
Then you can either create a new group and invite your friends, or you can join an existing one. 
Now you're ready to place a bet on yourself. You can pick which type of bet, the group your betting with, the amount your putting up, the frequency and time period. 

Now you're all set! Follow through with your bet, and nothing will happen.
If you fail the bet, then the amount you put up will be divided up and sent to all other members in your group. 
That's your motivation for following through. 

Alternatively, your friends might fail their bets and you'll be making some money. :)

This is a side project of mine for learning purposes, it is by no means ready to use...
